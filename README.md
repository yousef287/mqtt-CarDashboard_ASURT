# Real-Time Vehicle Telemetry Dashboard

A robust, real-time vehicle telemetry dashboard built using Qt/QML and UDP. This project receives and processes data from a vehicle (or simulation) including speed, RPM, GPS coordinates, wheel speeds, and other parameters, and displays them dynamically on an interactive UI.

## Introduction
The Real-Time Vehicle Telemetry Dashboard is a sophisticated desktop application designed to monitor and display various vehicle parameters in real time. Built with a multi-threaded architecture, it ensures efficient data processing and smooth UI updates, making it suitable for high-frequency telemetry data. The application features:

- Multi-threaded data processing for optimal performance
- Real-time UDP data transmission and processing
- Modern, responsive Qt/QML user interface
- Advanced visualization including GG diagrams and wheel speed indicators
- Comprehensive session management and data validation

## Key Features

### High-Performance Multi-Threading
- **Dedicated Receiver Thread:** Handles UDP packet reception without blocking the UI
- **Thread Pool for Data Parsing:** Multiple parser threads process incoming data concurrently
- **Non-blocking UI Updates:** Smooth interface updates even under heavy data loads
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Optimized thread management based on system capabilities

### Real-Time Data Processing
- High-frequency data reception and processing (up to thousands of packets per second)
- Zero-copy data handling for maximum performance
- Thread-safe data synchronization using atomic operations

### Advanced Telemetry Visualization
- **Dynamic GG Diagram:** Real-time visualization of lateral and longitudinal G-forces
- **Interactive Wheel Speed Display:** Individual speed monitoring for all four wheels
- **Comprehensive Dashboard:**
  - Vehicle speed and RPM gauges
  - Accelerator and brake pedal positions
  - Steering encoder angle visualization
  - Temperature and battery level monitoring
  - IMU parameters display
  - GPS route tracking with real-time updates

### Intelligent Session Management
- Secure session initialization and configuration
- Automatic port and connection management
- Data validation and error handling
- Smooth transition between session states

## Advanced Architecture

### Multi-Threaded Core
```cpp
class UdpClient {
    QThread m_receiverThread;            // Dedicated thread for UDP reception
    QThreadPool m_parserPool;           // Thread pool for parallel data parsing
    QList<UdpParserWorker *> m_parsers; // Multiple parser workers
    // ... other components
};
```

### Thread-Safe Data Handling
- Atomic operations for all telemetry data updates
- Lock-free algorithms for maximum performance
- Smart pointer usage for memory safety
- Event-driven communication between threads

### UDP Communication
- **UdpReceiverWorker:** Dedicated worker for efficient packet reception
- **UdpParserWorker:** Multiple workers for parallel data parsing
- **Thread Pool Management:** Dynamic scaling based on system load

### User Interface Layer
- **QML/C++ Integration:** Seamless binding between backend and frontend
- **Custom Components:** Specialized widgets for telemetry visualization
- **Responsive Design:** Dynamic layouts that adapt to any screen size

## Technologies Used
- **Qt 6+:** Modern C++ framework for cross-platform development
- **QML:** Declarative UI design language
- **C++17/20:** Advanced language features for robust implementation
- **Multi-threading:** Parallel processing for optimal performance
- **UDP Networking:** High-speed data transmission
- **QtLocation & QtPositioning:** GPS and mapping capabilities
- **Git:** Version control and collaboration

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Qt 6+** (with QtLocation and QtPositioning modules)
- **C++ Compiler:** Compatible with your Qt installation.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamedkhaled687/CarDashboard_ASURT.git
```

## Configuration

### UDP Settings
- **UDP Client:** Configure the listening port in the UdpClient component.
- **UDP Sender:** Set the destination IP address and port in the UDP Sender screen.

### Map Configuration
- **Map Plugin:** This project uses the OpenStreetMap (OSM) plugin. Ensure your network connection is available to load map tiles.
- **GPS Mapping:** Adjust mapping boundaries in the `gps.qml` file if necessary.

### Telemetry Data Format
UDP datagrams should be formatted as follows:
```
speed,rpm,accPedal,brakePedal,encoderAngle,temperature,batteryLevel,gpsLongitude,gpsLatitude,speedFL,speedFR,speedBL,speedBR
```

## Usage

### Running the Dashboard
- Start the application.
- Enter the destination IP and port on the UDP Sender screen.
- Use the random slider to simulate telemetry data.
- Click **"Send Data"** to transmit the data over UDP.
- The dashboard updates in real time as new data is received.

### Session Management
- **Session Creation:** Enter session details such as session name and port.
- **Waiting Screen:** After validation, the application transitions to a waiting screen.

### Map Interaction
- Use the zoom in/out buttons to adjust the map's zoom level.
- The map automatically centers on the latest GPS coordinate received.
- A blue line represents the vehicle's route on the map.
